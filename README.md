Breadth first search of a Binary Tree

Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. It is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc. Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore "ripple out" from the starting point.

We start traversing from tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and traverse the tree layer-wise, thus exploring the neighbor nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). We move towards the next-level neighbor nodes.
